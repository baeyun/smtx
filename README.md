# SMTX: A Robust SMT-LIB Static Validator

The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Type-checker (SMTX) is a specialized type checker built on Golangâ€™s type system that performs precise and efficient validation of SMT-LIB2 logical formulas.

SMTX is part of a larger project, SMTX, that focuses on improving SMT solving using static analysis and _pre-solver_ tools.

## Implementation

SMTX is implemented in Go, leveraging its strong type system and efficient compilation. The implementation focuses on:

- Type-safe validation of SMT-LIB2 (v2.6) expressions
- Efficient memory management using Go's garbage collection
- Modular design with separate theory implementations
- Performance optimization through concurrent validation

The core architecture consists of:

- A lexer/parser for SMT-LIB2 syntax
- Type inference and checking system
- Theory-specific validators
- Logic combinators
- Detailed error reporting and diagnostic suggestions
